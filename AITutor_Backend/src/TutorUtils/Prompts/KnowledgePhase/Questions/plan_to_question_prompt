// Input:
## Questions:
1. **Subject**: `CONCEPTUAL`  
   **Type**: `TEXT_ENTRY`  
   **Data**: "Compare and contrast the use of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches in agent AI. How do these approaches differ in their handling of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in unknown environments?"  
   **Concepts**: ['Reinforcement Learning', 'Model-based Approaches', 'Model-free Approaches']

2. **Subject**: `CODE`  
   **Type**: `CODE_ENTRY`  
   **Data**: "Write a Python function to implement a basic Q-learning algorithm for an agent in a grid world environment. Include considerations for state, action, and reward, and explain how the agent updates its policy over time."  
   **Concepts**: ['Q-learning']

3. **Subject**: `CONCEPTUAL`  
   **Type**: `TEXT_ENTRY`  
   **Data**: "In multi-agent systems, discuss the impact of cooperative versus competitive settings on the design of learning algorithms. What are the key challenges and strategies in developing agents that can adapt to cooperative and competitive dynamics?"  
   **Concepts**: ['Multi-Agent Systems', 'Cooperative Learning', 'Competitive Learning']

4. **Subject**: `MATH`  
   **Type**: `CALCULATION_ENTRY`  
   **Data**: "Given a simple Markov Decision Process (MDP), calculate the value function for a specified state using the Bellman equation. Describe the role of discount factor and rewards in your calculation."  
   **Concepts**: ['Markov Decision Process', 'Bellman Equation', 'Value Function', 'Discount Factor']

5. **Subject**: `CONCEPTUAL`  
   **Type**: `TEXT_ENTRY`  
   **Data**: "Explain the concept of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in the context of agent AI. How do POMDPs extend the standard MDP framework, and what are the implications for designing agents that operate in partially observable environments?"  
   **Concepts**: ['Markov Decision Process', 'Agent AI', 'Environment Observability']
