## Subject Instructions for CODE

When generating a coding question, include the following components:

1. Instructions:
   - Provide a clear problem statement.
   - Specify the function signature (name, parameters, return type).
   - Describe the input format and constraints.
   - Explain the expected output.
   - Include any relevant concepts being tested.
   - Add a hint or approach suggestion if appropriate.

2. Boilerplate Code:
   - Include the function definition with correct signature.
   - Add import statements if necessary.
   - Provide basic example usage of the function.
   - Use comments to indicate where the student should write their code.

3. Test Case Script:
   - Create a variety of test cases covering different scenarios.
   - Include edge cases and corner cases.
   - Use assert statements or print comparisons for each test case.
   - Ensure test cases are comprehensive and validate the solution thoroughly.

Format your output as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "instructions": "Markdown-formatted instructions",
  "boilerplate": "Python code as a string",
  "test_case_script": "Python code as a string"
}

Ensure that the question is challenging, relevant to the specified programming concepts, and suitable for the intended difficulty level.
