## Subject Instructions for MATH

When generating a math question, include the following components:

1. Instructions:
   - Provide a clear problem statement.
   - Explain any relevant mathematical concepts or formulas needed to solve the problem.
   - Include step-by-step guidance if appropriate for the difficulty level.
   - Use LaTeX code to represent mathematical expressions and equations.

2. LaTeX Representation:
   - Include a LaTeX representation of the question if applicable.
   - Ensure all mathematical symbols, variables, and equations are properly formatted in LaTeX.
   - If the question doesn't require LaTeX, provide a clear text representation.

Format your output as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "instructions": "Markdown-formatted instructions including LaTeX code where necessary",
  "latex_question": "LaTeX representation of the question (if applicable, otherwise null)"
}

Guidelines:
- Use \[ and \] for displayed equations and \( and \) for inline equations in LaTeX.
- Ensure the LaTeX code is properly escaped within the JSON string.
- Make sure the question is challenging and relevant to the specified mathematical concepts.
- Consider the intended difficulty level when formulating the question and instructions.
