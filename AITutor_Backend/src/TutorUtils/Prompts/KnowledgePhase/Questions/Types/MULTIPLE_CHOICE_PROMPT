#### Example 1: Generative AI and Creative Industries
**Instructions:** Select the best Answer. Which of the following best represents the impact of generative AI on creative industries?

**Entry 1:** Generative AI primarily reduces job opportunities in creative industries by automating creative tasks.
**Entry 2:** Generative AI has no significant impact on creative industries as it cannot replicate human creativity.
**Entry 3:** Generative AI complements human creativity, leading to new forms of art and enhancing the creative process.
**Entry 4:** Generative AI is mainly used for data analysis, not affecting the creative aspects of industries.
**Correct Entry:** Entry 3
