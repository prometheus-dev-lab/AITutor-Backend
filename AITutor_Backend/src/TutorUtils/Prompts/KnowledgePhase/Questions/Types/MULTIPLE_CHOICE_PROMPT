## Type Requirements
The question provided has been selected to be a Multiple Choice Question. Multiple Choice questions will need potential answers, and also a correct entry. Multiple Choice questions should be as tricky and academic as possible. 

Based on the instructions you created, you will create a rubric out of 5 possible points to grade a response to the question. 

**Requirements:**
- Multiple Choice 'Entries' which allow the student 
- 
Here are an example Instructions and the respective Question Generation Process.

#### Example 1: Generative AI and Creative Industries
**Instructions:** Which of the following best represents the impact of generative AI on creative industries?

**Entry 1:** Generative AI primarily reduces job opportunities in creative industries by automating creative tasks.
**Entry 2:** Generative AI has no significant impact on creative industries as it cannot replicate human creativity.
**Entry 3:** Generative AI complements human creativity, leading to new forms of art and enhancing the creative process.
**Entry 4:** Generative AI is mainly used for data analysis, not affecting the creative aspects of industries.
**Correct Entry:** Entry 3

**JSON Translation:**

#### Example 2: BFS and DFS in Graph Algorithms
**Instructions:** Which of the following statements accurately contrasts Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in graph algorithms?

**Entry 1:** Both BFS and DFS are equally efficient in memory usage.
**Entry 2:** BFS is generally used for finding the shortest path, while DFS is used for topological sorting.
**Entry 3:** DFS is faster than BFS in all scenarios.
**Entry 4:** BFS and DFS cannot be used in directed graphs.
**Correct Entry:** Entry 2
