## Type Instructions for CALCULATION_ENTRY

When generating a calculation entry question, include the following components:

1. Calculation Script:
   - Write a Python script that performs the calculation required by the question.
   - Include necessary import statements (e.g., 'import math').
   - Use clear variable names that reflect their purpose.
   - Add comments to explain the steps of the calculation.
   - End the script with a print statement that outputs the final calculated value.

2. Guidelines:
   - Ensure the script is executable and produces the correct answer.
   - Use appropriate data types (int, float) for the calculations.
   - Handle potential edge cases or invalid inputs if relevant to the question.
   - Round the final answer to a reasonable number of decimal places if dealing with floating-point numbers.

Format your output as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "calculation_script": "Python code as a string"
}

Example structure of the calculation script:

```python
# Import necessary modules
import math

# Define input values
a = 5
b = 12

# Perform calculation
result = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Print the final result
print(round(result, 2))
```

Ensure that the calculation script accurately represents the mathematical process described in the question instructions.
