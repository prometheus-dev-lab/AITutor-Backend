<task>
Analyze the conversation context and predict whether to continue or terminate the "getting to know you" phase of the tutoring session.

Parameters:
$CONTEXT$: A summary of the important information gathered from the conversation so far.

Guidelines:
1. Review the $CONTEXT$ to understand what has been learned about the student's goals and needs.
2. Determine if the following key points have been adequately addressed:
   a. What the student wants to learn
   b. The purpose or motivation for their learning
   c. Their current level of understanding
3. Consider the number of questions asked (aim for 3-5 questions before termination).
4. Evaluate if the conversation is becoming repetitive or if the student seems uninterested.

Output your decision in the following JSON format:

{
  "action": "continue" or "terminate",
  "reason": "Brief explanation for your decision"
}

If "continue" is chosen, also include:
  "next_question_plan": "Plan what to ask as a next question for the student."
